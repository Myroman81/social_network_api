# social_network_api

## Description

For this challenge we were asked to design a social network application.  This application would allow users to post thoughts create new user accounts and react to other users thoughts.  This framework is the backend element of the a fully functioning application that uses Express.Js, Node.Js, and MongoDB as the database.  Once again this challenge was particularly motivating as the popularity of social media doesn't show any signs of slowing down and this structure would be easy to implement and very user friendly.  It is however a work in progress that I plan to resubmit at a later date.  I was help by my instructor, Leif Hetland, the TA Fred Kamm, my classmates, and my tutor, Erik Hoversten.

## Installation

The repository must be cloned to your machine via the CLI.  From there you must install the dependencies via the command `npm install.`  To start your server you must next give the `node server.js` command in the terminal.
